# FastAPI PostgreSQL Backend Project

This project is a backend API developed with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL. It offers endpoints for user authentication and post management, including creation, update, deletion, and full CRUD operations on posts.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users have the ability to securely sign up and log in using JWT tokens.
- Secure Password Storage: Passwords are securely hashed before storing them in the database.
- Post Management: Users have the ability to create, update, delete, and retrieve posts based on specified parameters.

## Technologies Used

- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- SQLAlchemy: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- Pydantic: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
